# yolov8-scripts
collection for some of my yolov8 scripts


### Important
- C:\Users\$user\AppData\Roaming\Ultralytics\settings.yaml -> set "datasets_dir" to the directory you are working with:
- when training a classification model you need to specify a pretrained model -> model = YOLO('yolov8n-cls.pt')
